# Vegetation Units
# The header (1st row) represent the column codes. 
# The 1st column values (with the header/1st row: -9) are the vegetation unit codes. 
# The 2nd column values (with the header/1st row:  1) are vegetationCover: proportion of the pixel containing vegetation (dimensionless, fraction 0 to 1).
# The 3rd column values (with the header/1st row:  2) are leafAreaIndex (m2.m-2). 
# The 4th column values (with the header/1st row:  3) are plantHeight (m); representing the height from which raindrops fall from the crop or vegetation cover to the ground surface.
# The 5th column values (with the header/1st row:  4) are canopyCover: proportion/fraction of canopy cover within a cell (dimensionless, fraction 0 to 1).
# The 6th column values (with the header/1st row:  5) are groundCover percentage (dimensionless, fraction 0 to 1).
