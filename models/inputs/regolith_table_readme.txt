# Regolith Units
# The header (1st row) represent the column codes. 
# The 1st column values (with the header/1st row: -9) are the regolith unit codes. 
# The 2nd column values (with the header/1st row:  1) are kSat: saturated conductivity of the top soil (m.hr-1) - needed for estimating infiltration capacity
# The 3rd column values (with the header/1st row:  2) are cohesion (unit: kPa) of the soil - symbolyzed as COH in Morgan, 2001 
# The 4th column values (with the header/1st row:  3) are erodibilityK: erodibility (g.J-1) of the soil (symbolized as K in Morgan, 2001, Equation 9)
